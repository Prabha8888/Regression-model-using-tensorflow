# Regression-Model-using-Tensorflow 

* **TensorFlow** is one of the most popular deep leanining open source frame work developed bu Google. It is mainly used in deep learning in classification tasks such as text classification, image classification, voice recognization etc. But it can also be used for common machine regression tasks. This notebook shows how to perform regression tasks using TensorFlow.
